# Introduction

The Missing Strapi Docs is a project which aims to fill some of the gaps within the Strapi documentation specifically in regards to plugin development. It is a collection of articles on how to do specific things that are difficult to figure out with the current docs.

_These docs are meant for developers who already have a good understanding of Strapi if you are just getting started go to the official [docs](https://docs.strapi.io)_
